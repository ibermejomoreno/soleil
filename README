Soleil is an open-source package for the numerical simulation and
postprocessing of turbulent particle-laden flows with radiation

Currently it is written in Python

Quick start demo: 2D Taylor-Green vortex with particles:

0) Create ../TaylorGreen directory where the output data will be stored.

1) Run soleil
$ python soleil.py \
    soleilOptionsTaylorGreen2D.xml \
    ../TaylorGreen/output
Output files will be written under the ./TaylorGreen/ directory.

2) Visualize temperature field on slice with particles superimposed by circles with
velocity indicated by arrows (circles and arrows will be colored with the
corresponding particle temperature):
$ for timeStep in `seq 1 1 100`;do \
    python plotSoleil.py \
      ../TaylorGreen/output \
      $timeStep \
      temperature \
      1 1e4 10 \
      ../TaylorGreen/plot_temperature; \
  done

The sequence of plot files will be in the ../TaylorGreen/ directory,
with the 'plot' file prefix.
